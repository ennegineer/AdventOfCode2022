# Advent Of Code 2022

This is the first year I can follow the Advent of Code live, day by day! How exciting!

The Advent of Code was introduced to me during the week between Christmas and New Year's last year, so I had just missed the 2021 event. I have done a few days of several event years, but none to completion. Will this be the one I complete first?
